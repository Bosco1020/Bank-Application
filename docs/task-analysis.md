As someone with a bank account, the ability to perform your online banking remotely can provide some extremely large benefits to both the users and the company.

- **Difficulty maintaining enough branches for user access?** Whenever someone with a bank account want to withdraw or deposit any amount, even £5, they need to commute to a bank branch.

The software is easy to use and provides quick access to all a user's daily requirements, by advertising this it's sure to grab the attention of potential customers and show the appeal of moving their account to your bank.


### Documented Functionality
Based on the requirements provided by the BoDF, a set of functionalities have been identified that the software must be able to perform. The software will:
- Allow the access and ability to view a user's account,
- Facilitate the addition or subtraction of funds from the account,
- Regulate the accounts total funds between all transactions,


## The Software’s Benefits
With these features implemented, the software will be able to function as an effective console banking system, which the user can use to facilitate their banking needs, such as:

- By ensuring the console app enforces a simple and readable design layout, all information to the user is displayed in an easy to digest manner. By doing this, it ensures users won't get put off from having difficulty in obtaining the information they're looking for and thus helps ensure their perception of the app is a positive one.

- With one command, the software can provide a detailed documentation of your account's history and current available funds. Whether a user wants to check a payment went through, or is worried about going into debt, the software provides an easy method to give these users their answers in a swift manner.

- The software has a simple but easily expandable design, fulfilling all current functionality but with plenty of room for expansion. As the company wishes to add more functionality to the software and new requirements are identified, they can be easily added to the software’s core functionality. This allows it to be adjusted into the future to always meet the users’ needs and keep the software updated to be the best on the market.


## Associated Risks
As with all tools, the software will come with some risks that have been identified below.

- By providing external access to a user's account, it could also be an entry point for malicious users and become a vulnerability in the software. It's no surprise that there are some people who would look to abuse the access this app grants to alter account funds in a malicious manner. It would be wise to have a software security professional assist in the development of the application to ensure proper security of both the users and companies funds.

- The software failing is another risk as the hardware used to run the software is always at risk of power outages, environmental factors, and user mistakes. Any number of reasons can cause the software to fail, including issues outside of the hardware. If this occurs then not only may access to user's accounts be disrupted, but worst case scenario they may even have their account altered by some corruption.

- With all this functionality being implemented within the software, there's the chance that it may not perform a task from a user as expected. Whether its unexpected data type being used, an error in how the software handles various exceptions, or a miss-input from the user resulting in a transaction they hadn't desired, these accidents can have serious ramifications of a user's account information.


## Conclusion
By giving out software with direct access to user's bank accounts, you obviously invite malicious users who would looks to exploit this boon. However, the benefits of this software are great for both the users and the company. By providing a quick and easy way to conduct simple banking, users can have a more pleasant experience with not needing to spend as much time traveling to a bank. This also benefits the company, with the need to physical branch banks reducing there would be ways to save costs.

The software’s documented functionality covers all of the BoDF's listed requirements, but with its simple and robust framework it has potential to be expanded for future functionality the bank may wish to supply. So long as the risks are understood and protected against, this application will be an amazing addition to the companies feature set.
